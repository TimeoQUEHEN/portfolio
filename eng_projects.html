                    Flatcraft is a school project made in 2<sup>nd</sup> year of Lens' three year diploma in IT.<br>
                    It consists of a mix between Minecraft and Terraria, and we, as the students,
                    were to implement multiple functions, and overall, add content to the game,
                    as we were given just the skeleton of the game's code.</p>

                    The goal was to teach us to use an already existing API, and gather data using requests.
                    To allow that, we were tasked with creating a website in which a user could enter the name of a pokemon,
                    and the website would show all the relevant information about said pokemon.
                    Adiitionnal tasks were to handle authentication, allow a user to acces their search history
                    and favorite pokemons to easily acces them.

                    Paired to a group of 2<sup>nd</sup> year students in "Mutimedia and information jobs" at Lens,
                    We had to, during 36h, create a website where users could submit stories in the "where you are the hero" genre.
                    Additionnaly, users can comment under the different stories, change their avatar, favorite stories,
                    edit their stories and mark them as done.
                    We then had to create templates, request the database and modify it, handle the different permissions.

                    throughout a week, we, as students, were tasked to creat an application that generated images based on a file.
                    we had to create points, triangles, planes and sphere in order to make it work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To generated an image (called scene), the user feeds a text file to the application.
                    Inside the file is indicated the position of each point, the intensity of each light source,
                    the color and reflectability of each surface.
